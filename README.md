**🚦 RXRail – Railway Proximity IntelAlert System**

**Stay Alert. Stay Safe.**

RXRail is a free, open-source mobile app that warns users when they’re approaching railroad tracks or crossings.
Built with safety, awareness, and real-world impact in mind, RXRail uses real-time GPS and open mapping data to help prevent accidents caused by distraction.

🌍 **Our Mission**

RXRail was inspired by a personal loss that became a call to action:
to prevent distracted-approach accidents at railroad crossings using smart technology and open data.

Our goal is simple:
**Turn awareness into safety — because one alert can save a life.**
